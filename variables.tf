aws-cli is a bucket owned by amazon that will perminantly exist
It allows for the data source to be called during the destruction process without failing.
It doesn't get used for anything else, this is a safe workaround for handling the fact that 
if a data source like the one `aws_s3_bucket.selected` gets an error, you can't continue the terraform process
which also includes the 'destroy' command, where is doesn't even need this data source!
Don't change this bucket name, its a variable so that we can provide this description.
And this works around a problem that is an edge case.
